# Aimbot
A simple external Aimbot for CS-GO


I won't update the offsets.

To build the Aimbot, 
  - run the cmake_build.bat
  - then build the project (open the Solution and build it)


To use it, update the offsets in the .txt file, offsets can be found here https://github.com/frk1/hazedumper/blob/master/csgo.hpp

Defaultbutton to turn on the Aimbot is the key 'o', but it can be changed in the config file
